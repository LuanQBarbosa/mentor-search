 The Mentor Search application is a Vue.js project developed with the purpose of practicing front-end development using the framework and the use of **Vue Router** to simulate different pages on the SPA and **Vuex** to centralize data management. The main goal of the application is to be an easy platform for registration and search of mentors on different expertises. The app is using Firebase as a dumb Rest API.
